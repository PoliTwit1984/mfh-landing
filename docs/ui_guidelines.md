# UI Implementation Guide for AI Agents

This guide provides a structured approach for AI coding agents to implement UI in React projects using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

---

## Framework Selection: Vite vs Next.js

**Choose the right tool for the job.** Before starting any project, use this decision matrix:

**Company Standard: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

All projects deploy to **Google Cloud Run**. Choose your frontend framework based on app requirements, not hosting.

### When to Use Vite + Express (Recommended Default)

| Scenario | Why Vite |
|----------|----------|
| **Single-page app (SPA)** | No server-side rendering needed |
| **Landing pages / Dashboards** | Static content with API calls |
| **Custom server requirements** | Full control over CSP, rate limiting, middleware |
| **Separate backend** | Python/Flask, Go, or custom Express API |
| **Maximum build speed** | Vite's HMR is noticeably faster on large projects |

**Setup:** `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`

### When to Use Next.js

| Scenario | Why Next.js |
|----------|-------------|
| **SEO-critical content** | Blog, e-commerce, news sites need server rendering |
| **File-based routing preferred** | Convention over configuration |
| **React Server Components** | Need streaming, partial hydration, server actions |
| **Image optimization built-in** | next/image handles responsive images automatically |

**Setup:** `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`

**Note:** Next.js deploys to Cloud Run the same way - just containerize it.

### Quick Decision Flowchart

```text
Does the site need SEO for dynamic content?
├── YES → Next.js + Cloud Run
└── NO → Vite + Express + Cloud Run (default)
```

### Python Comparison (for context)

| JavaScript Stack | Python Equivalent | Description |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Next.js** | **Django** | Full-stack, opinionated, batteries included |
| **Vite + Express** | **React + Flask** | Separate frontend/backend, maximum flexibility |
| **Express only** | **Flask** | Minimal backend framework |

## Project Setup

The setup instructions below cover both Vite and Next.js approaches. Use whichever matches your project.

### Option A: Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

```bash
# 1. Create Vite project
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app

# 2. Install Tailwind
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# 3. Configure tailwind.config.js content paths
# 4. Add Tailwind directives to src/index.css

# 5. Initialize shadcn/ui
npx shadcn@latest init

# 6. Add components as needed
npx shadcn@latest add button card
```

### Option B: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

Project Setup (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

1. Initialize the Next.js Project: Create a new Next.js app with TypeScript. You can either use the Next.js CLI or the shadcn UI CLI (which can scaffold a Next.js project for you):
	•	Using Create Next App: Run npx create-next-app@latest --typescript your-project-name. This sets up a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript. After creation, install Tailwind CSS and its peer deps with npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer, then run npx tailwindcss init -p to generate config files. Integrate Tailwind by adding @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; to your global CSS (e.g. app/globals.css). Also, configure tailwind.config.js content paths to include your app and components directories for Tailwind to pick up classes.
	•	Using shadcn CLI: Run npx shadcn@latest init. The CLI can detect an existing Next.js app or create a new one for you ￼. For new projects, it will scaffold Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other essentials pre-configured ￼. The init process will ask a few configuration questions (e.g. whether to use CSS variables for theming, paths for your global CSS and tailwind config, etc.) ￼. You can safely accept defaults for most prompts. After initialization, ensure that Tailwind’s config (tailwind.config.js or .ts) includes the paths to your app and components folders (the shadcn init should handle this). The CLI will also set up a default globals.css with CSS variables if you opted in for theming.

2. Install shadcn/ui Components: Once the project is ready, use the shadcn CLI to add pre-built UI components. For example, to add a Button component run:

npx shadcn@latest add button

This command copies the source for the <Button> component into your project under components/ui/button.tsx ￼. All shadcn components are plain TypeScript + JSX, not packaged binaries – “no npm package, no black box” ￼. This means the agent can read and modify the component’s code freely. Import the component in your app like:

// app/page.tsx (or any React component)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </main>
  );
}

Repeat shadcn add ... for any other needed components (e.g. card, tabs, etc.). Each added UI component lives in your codebase (usually in components/ui), which ensures the AI agents can directly see and change how the component works. Tip: The first component added will also set up components.json (used by the CLI) and a utility file lib/utils.ts with the class merge helper cn() if they don’t exist yet ￼.

3. Finalize Tailwind Config: The Tailwind configuration should already include essential settings after running the init. Double-check these in tailwind.config.js:
	•	Content paths: include all relevant file globs (e.g. app/**/*.{ts,tsx}, components/**/*.{ts,tsx}) so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles ￼.
	•	Dark mode: typically set to "class" (so dark mode is toggled via a class="dark" on <html>).
	•	Theme extensions: shadcn’s setup might add CSS variables for colors in globals.css. Ensure those map in Tailwind’s theme (e.g. background uses var(--background) etc. as provided by shadcn). You can further extend the theme with custom design tokens (colors, font, spacing scales) as needed – more on that in the Tailwind best practices section.

With the project scaffolding complete, you have a Next.js app (App Router structure) with Tailwind ready and shadcn’s system in place. The file structure will look something like this:

.
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx        (Application shell layout)
│   └── page.tsx          (Home page component)
├── components/
│   ├── ui/               (Shadcn UI components live here)
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   ├── card.tsx
│   │   └── ... (other UI components)
│   ├── layout/           (Layout components like shells, navigation, headers)
│   ├── custom/           (Custom project-specific components)
│   └── ... (other components)
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts          (Utility functions, e.g. cn for classNames)
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css       (Tailwind base styles + CSS variables)
├── tailwind.config.js    (Tailwind configuration)
├── tsconfig.json         (TypeScript config with path aliases)
└── package.json

This structure is designed for clarity and scalability ￼ ￼:
	•	components/ui/ – All low-level UI design system components from shadcn (e.g. Button, Card, Input, etc.) reside here ￼. These are the atomic reusable pieces of the UI, usually copied from the shadcn library. AI agents can modify these for styling or new variants, but their core logic and accessibility attributes should generally be preserved.
	•	components/layout/ – High-level layout components that define the overall page structure. This is where components like the dashboard shell, navigation menu, page header, or footer might live. (In some projects, these might just be in components/ root, but organizing them in a layout folder makes it clear they are structural.)
	•	components/custom/ – Any other custom components specific to your application’s domain or complex widgets that don’t belong in ui (design system) and are not global layout. For example, a complex form component or a chart wrapper could go here. This separation helps agents know where to add new UI pieces: use ui for generic reusable components, custom for app-specific ones.
	•	lib/ – Utilities and helpers. By default it contains utils.ts with the cn(...classes) helper for merging Tailwind class names conditionally ￼. You might add other utility modules here (e.g. a data fetching helper, or context providers if needed). AI agents should generally treat these as helper logic, editing or extending them only when new utility functionality is needed.
	•	styles/ – Global styles directory. Typically just globals.css which includes Tailwind’s base and components, plus CSS custom properties for theme colors (if using shadcn’s theming) ￼. Agents should be cautious when editing this file – usually only update global CSS if adding new theme variables or overriding very global styles. Most styling should be done via Tailwind classes in components, not by editing CSS here.
	•	app/ – Next.js App Router files. app/layout.tsx is the root layout (common wrappers, providers, and the <body> element). app/page.tsx is the homepage. In a real project you will have multiple routes (e.g. app/dashboard/page.tsx, app/dashboard/layout.tsx for a sub-layout, etc.). Agents can edit page and layout files when implementing navigation or page-level structure, but those are considered part of the “protected” core structure – changes here affect many pages, so they should align with project-wide intentions.

Agent Edit Permissions: In a multi-agent setup, it’s important to mark certain files as protected (requiring caution or single-agent ownership) vs freely editable. Here are guidelines:
	•	Project config files (like next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, package.json): Protected – edit only if absolutely necessary (e.g. adding a Tailwind plugin or Next.js config change) and with one agent at a time, since these affect the entire project.
	•	Global styles (globals.css): Protected – contains base styles and CSS variables. Avoid arbitrary changes here; use Tailwind utilities in components instead. Only edit for theme-level changes (like defining new CSS variables or adjusting fonts).
	•	Design system components (components/ui/*): Editable with care – AI agents can modify these UI components (e.g. to adjust styling or add a new variant state) because owning the code is the point of using shadcn ￼ ￼. However, do not remove required props, ARIA attributes, or structural elements that the component relies on (especially for interactive components). Follow the established pattern in the file (for example, if button.tsx uses a variant mechanism via a config object, preserve that pattern when extending it).
	•	Layout and custom components (components/layout/* and components/custom/*): Editable – these are your application’s bespoke components. Agents can create new files here or update existing ones freely when implementing features. Ensure to keep their purpose focused (e.g. a DashboardShell should remain a layout wrapper, not start containing unrelated logic).
	•	Page and Layout files in app/: Editable with care – these define routing and high-level structure. Agents can add new pages or modify layouts, but since these glue the whole app together, avoid conflicting edits. Typically one agent should manage adding a new route or modifying a layout at a time, to prevent race conditions.
	•	Utility files (lib/utils.ts etc.): Protected – utility functions are usually stable. Add new helpers if needed, but avoid renaming or removing existing ones as many components might depend on them (e.g. the cn function is used across UI components for class merging).

By adhering to these boundaries, multiple agents can work concurrently on UI tasks with minimal merge conflicts – e.g. one agent can build a new SectionCard component in components/custom/, while another styles a form inside a page, both without stepping on global config.

Tailwind CSS Best Practices for Consistent UI

Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes, which agents should use in a consistent, design-system-driven way. Here are best practices to follow:
	•	Use the Design Token Scale – Avoid Magic Numbers: Stick to the defined spacing, sizing, and color scales from the Tailwind config (or your extended theme). Do not scatter arbitrary values like p-[23px] or text-[#123456] in classes, as this defeats consistency. Instead, define and use semantic tokens. For example, if you need a custom spacing, add it to the theme (e.g. define md: '8px' in the spacing scale) and then use p-md in your markup ￼ ￼. This ensures design consistency and easy theming across the app. The default Tailwind spacing scale (e.g. p-4 for 1rem, p-5 for 1.25rem, etc.) should cover most needs. Only extend it with deliberate token names (like xs, sm, md, lg spacing) rather than many one-off values ￼.
	•	Leverage Tailwind’s Utility Patterns: Keep class lists concise by using shorthand utilities. For example, use py-4 instead of separate pt-4 pb-4, and omit default values like flex-row (since flex is row by default) ￼. Combine border utilities (e.g. border-2 border-dotted border-gray-300/50 instead of four separate classes) ￼. This makes the HTML less verbose and easier for any agent (or developer) to parse quickly.
	•	Responsive Design with Consistent Breakpoints: Utilize Tailwind’s responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) which correspond to your defined breakpoints (default or custom in config). Ensure all agents use the same breakpoints (as defined in tailwind.config.js) to avoid mismatched behavior. For example, if building a grid of cards, you might use grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 so it displays 1 column on mobile, 2 on small screens, 4 on medium and up. By following the agreed breakpoints, agents can safely add responsive classes without conflict.
	•	Semantic Colors and Styling: Use the design tokens or CSS variables provided by shadcn’s theme for colors and font styles. For instance, use classes like text-primary or bg-secondary if those are defined, or use shadcn’s semantic color classes like bg-background, text-foreground, text-muted-foreground, etc., which map to CSS variables in globals.css. This ensures that your components automatically adapt to theme changes (like dark mode) and remain consistent. Avoid hard-coding raw color codes in class names. The shadcn/ui default theme uses CSS variables (e.g. --background, --muted-foreground) for theming – agents should respect those by using the corresponding utility classes rather than arbitrary colors.
	•	Layout Structure Utilities: Tailwind excels at layout. Agents should use flexbox and grid utilities for alignment and spacing, rather than custom CSS. For example, use flex, justify-between, items-center for horizontal layouts, or use grid, gap-4 for uniform grids. Consistency here is key: decide on common patterns (e.g. a form might always be a flex flex-col gap-4) so all agents use the same approach. Document these patterns or include them in component templates so they are copy-paste ready for the AI.
	•	Keep Components DRY and Encapsulated: If you notice the same combination of classes used repeatedly for a UI pattern, it likely should be abstracted into a reusable component rather than copied each time. For example, a specific card style with rounded-lg border p-4 bg-card classes can be made into a <Card> component (as shadcn does) instead of repeating that markup. This aligns with the component-based approach and prevents divergence in style usage ￼ ￼. AI agents can then instantiate that component rather than reinventing it, improving reliability.
	•	Avoid Excessive @apply or CSS Overrides: Prefer Tailwind classes in the JSX over moving styles to a CSS file with @apply. Using @apply in a CSS file to bundle utilities might make the file look cleaner, but it hides information from the AI agent and can lead to duplicated logic ￼. The strength of Tailwind (for AI) is that the styling is visible right where the component is defined. So only use @apply for truly repetitive low-level patterns that cannot be abstracted into a React component. Similarly, avoid adding global CSS overrides for component classes; instead, change the component’s JSX or its Tailwind classes directly so the change is local and transparent.
	•	Accessibility and Semantics: Continue to use proper HTML semantic elements (Tailwind doesn’t change that). E.g., use heading tags (<h1>, <h2>) for titles like in a PageHeader, use <button> for interactive buttons (shadcn components already do this), etc. Also use ARIA roles/attributes as needed. Shadcn’s components are built on Radix UI￼ under the hood, which handles a lot of accessibility for you. Agents should preserve any aria-* attributes or roles present in these components, and similarly ensure custom components follow suit. For example, if creating a new dropdown, follow the pattern of using role="menu" and keyboard handlers similar to existing components. This keeps the app accessible and consistent.

Following these Tailwind guidelines ensures a uniform style and makes it easier for multiple agents to predict and follow the established patterns (spacing units, class naming, component structure) without tripping over unexpected values. Consistent usage of design tokens and utility classes will greatly improve the AI success rate in modifying or extending the UI, since the rules are the same everywhere.

Responsive Design Strategy (Mobile-First)

To ensure the app looks perfect on any device (Phone, Tablet, Desktop), agents must follow a strict **Mobile-First** strategy.

### 1. The Mobile-First Rule
**Write styles for mobile screens FIRST, then override for larger screens.**
*   ❌ **Bad**: `flex-row max-md:flex-col` (Desktop first, fighting against defaults)
*   ✅ **Good**: `flex flex-col md:flex-row` (Mobile default, expands on desktop)

### 2. Standard Breakpoints
Stick to the Tailwind defaults. Do not invent custom pixel values.
*   **Default (Mobile)**: `< 640px` (Phones). Layouts are stacked (1 column).
*   **`sm:` (Tablet Portrait)**: `≥ 640px`.
*   **`md:` (Tablet Landscape / Laptop)**: `≥ 768px`. Sidebar appears, grids become 2-3 cols.
*   **`lg:` (Desktop)**: `≥ 1024px`. Max width constraints kick in.

### 3. Layout Patterns
| Component | Mobile Behavior | Desktop Behavior (`md:` or `lg:`) | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Layout** | Single column, full width. | Sidebar + Content area. | `flex flex-col md:flex-row` |
| **Navigation** | Hamburger menu opens a **Sheet**. | Visible TopNav or Sidebar. | Use `hidden md:flex` for desktop nav. |
| **Grids (Cards)** | 1 column (vertical stack). | 2, 3, or 4 columns. | `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` |
| **Tables** | Hide non-essential columns. | Show full data. | `hidden md:table-cell` on extra cols. |
| **Modals** | Full-screen Sheet or Drawer. | Centered Dialog. | Use `Dialog` but check screen width if complex. |

### 4. Touch Targets & Sizing
*   **Buttons**: Must be at least 44px high on mobile. Use `h-10` or `h-12`.
*   **Inputs**: Font size must be at least 16px to prevent iOS zoom.
*   **Spacing**: Use tighter spacing on mobile (`gap-4`, `p-4`) and looser on desktop (`md:gap-6`, `md:p-8`).

### 5. Testing
Agents should verify layouts by mentally "resizing" the window:
1.  Does the sidebar disappear on mobile?
2.  Do the cards stack vertically?
3.  Is the text readable without horizontal scrolling?

Core Reusable UI Patterns and Templates

In a structured dashboard or application UI, certain patterns appear frequently. This section defines core reusable components – DashboardShell, PageHeader, SectionCard, and StatsGrid – with guidance on their implementation. These serve as templates that AI agents can copy or adapt. Each component is kept simple, predictable, and composable, using Tailwind utilities and shadcn/ui building blocks:

DashboardShell (Layout Container)

The DashboardShell is a layout component that provides the overall page chrome for authenticated or dashboard pages. It typically includes a sidebar navigation, an optional top navigation bar, and a main content area. It can be used as the root layout for dashboard routes or as a wrapper component in pages. An example implementation:

// components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx
import React from "react";
// Import other layout pieces if needed, e.g. Sidebar, TopNav components

interface DashboardShellProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function DashboardShell({ children }: DashboardShellProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen">
      {/* Sidebar: shown on medium+ screens, hidden on mobile (could use a Drawer for mobile) */}
      <aside className="hidden md:flex md:w-64 bg-background border-r">
        {/* Sidebar content (navigation menu) goes here. 
            This can be a separate Sidebar component or static links */}
      </aside>

      {/* Main area: flex column to include optional top nav and page content */}
      <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col">
        {/* Top navigation bar / header (optional) */}
        <header className="border-b bg-background">
          {/* e.g., could include a button to toggle sidebar on mobile, user profile menu, etc. 
              Keep it minimal in this template. */}
        </header>

        {/* Main content */}
        <main className="flex-1 p-6">{children}</main>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

Guidance:
	•	The shell uses a full-height flex layout (min-h-screen) to split the screen into sidebar and main content.
	•	Sidebar (<aside>) is hidden on small screens (hidden md:flex) and has a fixed width on desktop (e.g. md:w-64). It’s common to implement a mobile-friendly sidebar using a Drawer/Sheet from shadcn/ui for smaller screens, but that can be added later.
	•	The main area is a flex column that contains an optional <header> and the <main> content. The header is separated with a bottom border for visual separation.
	•	Padding (p-6 here, i.e. 1.5rem) is applied to the main content area to give spacing from the shell edges. Use the design spacing scale (you might choose p-4 or p-8 depending on desired spacing).
	•	Usage: In a Next.js App Router, you might wrap page content with DashboardShell in a layout file. For example, if you have a route app/dashboard/*, your app/dashboard/layout.tsx could return:

import { DashboardShell } from "@/components/layout/dashboard-shell";
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return <DashboardShell>{children}</DashboardShell>;
}

This ensures all dashboard pages get the shell structure. Alternatively, you can use DashboardShell directly in each page component if not using nested layouts. The key is that the shell is reusable – one place to edit the overall structure of the dashboard.

	•	Agent notes: Keep DashboardShell a pure layout (no business logic). If state is needed (e.g. to toggle sidebar on mobile), make it a client component by adding "use client" at the top and use React state or context. Otherwise, it can remain a server component (pure markup) which is preferred for performance ￼.

PageHeader (Section Heading and Actions)

The PageHeader component provides a standardized header for pages or sections, typically containing a title, an optional description, and optional action buttons (like a “New Item” button) on the right. This helps ensure every page has a consistent look for its title section. Example implementation:

// components/layout/page-header.tsx
import React from "react";

interface PageHeaderProps {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  /** Optional React node for an action, e.g. <Button>Add</Button> */
  action?: React.ReactNode;
}

export function PageHeader({ title, description, action }: PageHeaderProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-4 py-4">
      <div className="flex flex-col">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold leading-tight">{title}</h1>
        {description && (
          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">{description}</p>
        )}
      </div>
      {action && (
        <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">{action}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

Guidance:
	•	We use a container div with flexbox to arrange the title on the left and action on the right (justify-between). A small gap or padding (gap-4 py-4) gives spacing around the header.
	•	The title is a <h1> (or you could allow passing a level prop if needed). It uses a larger font (Tailwind text-2xl for example) and bold weight. We also ensure tight line-height for a compact title (leading-tight).
	•	The description, if provided, is a smaller, muted text (text-sm text-muted-foreground). Note: text-muted-foreground is a Tailwind class provided by shadcn’s default theme to indicate secondary text color; it relies on CSS variables for the exact color.
	•	The action prop can be any React node, often a <Button> or a group of buttons/links for page actions. We wrap it in a container with space-x-2 to nicely separate multiple action buttons.
	•	By encapsulating this pattern, all pages using PageHeader will have consistent spacing and styling. Agents generating new pages should include <PageHeader title="Your Page" description="..." action={...} /> at the top of the page content, instead of open-coding their own h1 tags, to keep consistency.
	•	Agent notes: PageHeader is a simple server component (just UI). It should remain presentational. Any stateful logic (e.g. if an action opens a modal, that logic belongs in the page or a different component, not in PageHeader). This separation keeps PageHeader reusable and side-effect free.

SectionCard (Card Container for Content Sections)

The SectionCard is a reusable card container for grouping related content. Use it to frame a section of the UI with a subtle background and optional heading. Internally, it uses the shadcn <Card> component for consistency (which is basically a styled div with border and background). Example:

// components/ui/section-card.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface SectionCardProps {
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  /** You could add other props like subtitle or actions if needed */
}

export function SectionCard({ title, children }: SectionCardProps) {
  return (
    <Card>
      {title && (
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle className="text-lg">{title}</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
      )}
      <CardContent>
        {children}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}

Guidance:
	•	This component composes the pre-built UI Card from shadcn. The Card component provides a styled container (with default padding, border, and background based on your theme). Inside it, we optionally render a header with the title.
	•	CardHeader, CardTitle, and CardContent are sub-components provided by the Card implementation (they basically render appropriate markup with consistent spacing – CardTitle is typically a <h3> element styled accordingly). We add a utility class to CardTitle (text-lg in this case) to adjust its size slightly if needed.
	•	The children go into CardContent, which ensures proper padding inside the card.
	•	This pattern makes it easy for agents to create new sections: by wrapping content in <SectionCard title="Section Name"> ... </SectionCard>, the section will have a consistent card appearance (with a title area).
	•	Alternative: You could achieve a similar result with a plain <div> using Tailwind (e.g. className="rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground p-4"). In fact, those classes are what the Card component uses internally. But using <Card> ensures any future changes to card styling (shadow, radius, etc.) propagate consistently. It also reduces markup in the component.
	•	Agent notes: Ensure that the Card component is added to the project (via shadcn add card) before using SectionCard. Agents should import from the local @/components/ui/card as shown. Like other small components, SectionCard is presentational and can be a server component.

StatsGrid (Metric Cards Overview)

The StatsGrid displays a grid of statistics or key performance indicators, typically as a set of small cards with a numeric value and label (and possibly an icon or trend indicator). This is common in dashboards for showing summary metrics. An implementation might look like:

// components/custom/stats-grid.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface StatItem {
  label: string;
  value: string | number;
  change?: string;        // e.g. "+5%" or "-2%" change indicator
  icon?: React.ReactNode; // e.g. an icon element to display with the stat
}

interface StatsGridProps {
  stats: StatItem[];
}

export function StatsGrid({ stats }: StatsGridProps) {
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4">
      {stats.map((item, index) => (
        <Card key={index}>
          <CardContent className="p-4">
            <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{item.label}</div>
            <div className="text-2xl font-bold">{item.value}</div>
            {item.change && (
              <div 
                className={`text-sm ${item.change.startsWith('+') ? 'text-green-600' : 'text-red-600'}`}
              >
                {item.change}
              </div>
            )}
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

Guidance:
	•	We render a CSS grid (grid gap-4) that automatically creates a responsive layout: 2 columns on small screens (sm:grid-cols-2), 4 columns on medium (md:grid-cols-4), and it will flow to 1 column on extra-small screens by default ￼. Agents should maintain these breakpoint conventions when adjusting columns.
	•	Each stat is inside a Card for consistent styling. We use CardContent and add an extra padding class just to ensure ample spacing (p-4) for the content.
	•	Inside each card, we display the label (small muted text), the value (large and bold), and an optional change indicator. The change text is colored green or red depending on a leading “+” or “-” (this simple logic is implemented with a conditional class; in a more advanced scenario you might pass a trend: 'up' | 'down' instead of raw string).
	•	The icon field in StatItem could be used to render an icon next to the value or label, but usage of icons is optional. If needed, you could integrate an icon by placing {item.icon} somewhere in the CardContent div.
	•	Usage: The parent agent (or developer) would pass in an array of stat objects to StatsGrid. For example:

<StatsGrid stats={[
  { label: "Total Users", value: 1234, change: "+5%" },
  { label: "Active Sessions", value: 87, change: "-2%" },
  // ...more items
]} />

This will render a grid of 4 cards (if 4 items) showing each stat.

	•	This component is mostly UI logic and can be a server component (the stats data can be fetched in the parent and passed in). If the stats need live updating or interactive tooltips, that would require making it a client component, but in most cases displaying static numbers is fine on the server side.
	•	Agent notes: Ensure to use consistent formatting for numbers and percentages (the agent might include utility functions or intl formatting if needed, but that’s beyond UI structure). Also maintain the grid class conventions; if adjusting the number of columns, do so by props or consistent breakpoints rather than removing responsive classes, so the grid remains responsive as intended.

Additional Patterns

(Depending on project needs, more patterns can be defined similarly, such as a DashboardSidebar for the side navigation menu, a DataTable for tabular data, etc. The four patterns above are the ones specifically requested.)

For any new pattern, follow the same approach: create a dedicated component with clearly defined props for any variable content, use Tailwind for layout, and compose shadcn/ui components if available (for example, use the <Table> component from shadcn for building a DataTable). Provide a template for the structure so that agents can replicate the pattern consistently.

Server vs Client Components Considerations

Next.js 13+ with the App Router distinguishes between Server Components and Client Components. Agents must be aware of this when implementing UI:
	•	Prefer Server Components for UI when possible: By default, files inside app/ and any components imported there are treated as Server Components (unless you add "use client" at the top). Server Components render on the server and send HTML to the client, which is great for static content and avoids including unnecessary JavaScript. Most simple UI components (headers, cards, static lists) can be server components. For example, a Card or Badge with no interactive behavior works perfectly as a Server Component ￼.
	•	Use Client Components for interactivity: If a component needs to handle user interaction (onClick handlers, local state with useState, effects with useEffect, etc.), it must be a Client Component. To declare one, put a "use client" directive at the top of the component file. Many shadcn/ui components that are interactive come with this directive in their code already (e.g. dialogs, dropdown menus, toast) so that you don’t have to think about it ￼. But if you wrap those in another component or create new interactive components, ensure you carry over the "use client" directive.
	•	Mixing server and client components: It’s perfectly fine to use server components that render client components inside them. For instance, you can have a server-rendered page that includes a <ThemeToggle /> client component. Next.js will seamlessly hydrate the client part. Agents should therefore structure pages such that the top-level can often remain a server component (for fast load and SEO), and only specific parts are client as needed.
	•	Data fetching: If a component fetches data via Next.js fetch() (which is recommended in Server Components for simplicity), that component should be a Server Component (since fetch in a client component would run in the browser, which is rarely what you want for initial data). Conversely, if a component needs access to window or browser-only APIs, it must be client. Recognize these scenarios and mark components appropriately.
	•	Hydration Mismatch Warnings: If agents see hydration errors, it often means something that was rendered on the server is relying on client-only data. The solution is usually to move that piece into a Client Component ￼. For example, if a StatsGrid wanted to auto-update using a WebSocket, it should be a client component (or have a small client child for the dynamic part).
	•	shadcn/UI specifics: The shadcn components library is built with server compatibility in mind – many components are pure markup, and those that require JS (e.g. modal dialogs) include the necessary "use client". When adding a new shadcn component via the CLI, pay attention to the top of the file. If you see "use client", you know it’s meant to run in the browser. Do not remove those. If you accidentally use an interactive shadcn component inside a server component without the proper wrapper, Next.js will throw an error – fix by either making the parent a client component or lazy-loading the interactive part.

In summary, use server components by default for rendering UI and data because they are more efficient, but switch to client for anything interactive or time-sensitive on the client. This hybrid approach is key to Next.js App Router architecture.

shadcn/ui Usage Rules and Tips

Shadcn/ui is essentially a collection of ready-to-use components that you own in your codebase. To use it effectively in an AI-driven coding workflow, keep in mind:
	•	Import from Your Code, Not from a Package: All shadcn components should be imported via the local paths (e.g. @/components/ui/button) as they exist in your project files ￼. Do not mix in imports from an external UI library – this could confuse the agent as the patterns and accessibility hooks would differ. By sticking to local imports, the AI can read all component implementations. For example, if a design calls for a custom toggle, add it via the CLI (shadcn add toggle) then use import { Toggle } from "@/components/ui/toggle" in your component code.
	•	Adhere to the Component’s Structure When Extending: The shadcn components are typically built with certain internal structure and conventions:
	•	They often use a utility like cn() to merge classes, especially to handle conditional styles or variants.
	•	Many components use the Radix UI primitives under the hood for accessibility. For instance, dropdown-menu.tsx uses Radix’s DropdownMenu context. When customizing, don’t remove or rename important parts of the JSX (like the DropdownMenu.Group or aria-* attributes) unless you understand the effect. Agents should aim to extend components (add new variants, tweak classes) rather than rewrite their core logic.
	•	If adding a new variant to a component (say a new Button style), follow the existing pattern (likely there’s a variants object using cva – add your variant there and in the TypeScript props). Keep naming consistent and descriptive.
	•	Don’t Override Core Theme Styles Globally: Shadcn’s components derive their colors and sizing from the design tokens (CSS variables in globals.css and Tailwind theme). Avoid overriding these base styles with global CSS, as it defeats the purpose of theming. If the primary color needs to change, update it via Tailwind config or CSS variables, not by adding new classes everywhere. This way, all components that use bg-primary or text-foreground automatically update. Remember, “owning your components” means you can change the source – if a component’s style isn’t to your liking, open its file and modify the classes or styling in that file directly ￼. This localized modification is easier for the AI to manage than juggling a lot of override CSS.
	•	Follow Semantic Version of Components: When using components like <Button> or <Card>, use them for their intended purpose. For example, don’t misuse a Card component to behave like a modal – if you need a modal, use the <Dialog> component. The library provides many primitives. Agents should search within the project’s components/ui folder (or add via CLI) for an appropriate component instead of creating one from scratch. This ensures consistent behavior and styling. It also means less custom code to maintain.
	•	Leverage Community Extensions Carefully: Shadcn’s ecosystem might have additional community components (like charts, datatables, etc.). If your project includes them (or if an agent is instructed to add one), treat those components the same way – they live in components/ui, they follow the same class-based Tailwind styling, and they should be kept consistent. Do not introduce a drastically different UI framework or styling method for one-off needs, as it will reduce the overall predictability for agents.
	•	Every Component is Yours to Customize: This bears repeating – if a component doesn’t do exactly what you need, the agent can and should modify it. Change the markup or Tailwind classes as needed, or extend its props. Shadcn/ui’s philosophy is that since these are copy-pasted components, you have full control ￼. For example, if the default <AlertDialog> component doesn’t support a certain size, you can add a new size class in its code. When doing so, maintain the coding style (consistent indentation, clear naming) so that other agents (or future runs) understand the changes. Commenting the change with a brief note can also help, but the code itself should be clear enough.
	•	What Not to Do: Do not attempt to update shadcn components by re-running the CLI add command on an already modified component (this could overwrite your changes). Instead, updates should be manual merges if you ever sync with a newer shadcn template. Also, avoid adding excessive logic in UI components – keep them focused on presentation. Business logic or data fetching belongs in Next.js route handlers, page components, or in useEffect hooks in client components as appropriate, not buried in the UI component files.

Testing & Error Handling Strategy

### 1. Frontend Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)
*   **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (e.g., `StatsGrid`) to ensure they render props correctly.
    ```bash
    npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
    ```
*   **Integration Tests**: Test user flows (e.g., "Clicking Generate calls the API").
*   **Mocking**: Use `vi.mock` to mock API calls. Never hit the real backend in frontend tests.

### 2. Standard Error Handling
*   **API Errors**: If the backend returns `400` or `500`, **ALWAYS** show a Toast notification.
    ```tsx
    import { toast } from "sonner";
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      toast.error("Something went wrong", { description: "Please try again." });
    }
    ```
*   **Validation Errors**: Display inline below the input field (use `zod` + `react-hook-form` for this).
*   **Boundaries**: Wrap major sections (like the "Try-On" area) in an `<ErrorBoundary>` so the whole app doesn't crash if one component fails.

Component Selection Guide (When to use what?)

To prevent "reinventing the wheel," consult this menu before creating custom components:

| Need | Recommended Component | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layout** | | |
| Sidebar / Mobile Menu | **Sheet** | Use `Sheet` for slide-out panels. |
| Modal / Popup | **Dialog** | For critical interactions requiring focus. |
| Confirmation | **AlertDialog** | For destructive actions (e.g., "Delete"). |
| Dropdown Menu | **DropdownMenu** | For actions/links. Use `Select` for forms. |
| **Data Display** | | |
| Tabular Data | **Table** | Use shadcn's `Table` primitives. |
| Key/Value List | **DescriptionList** (Custom) | Or use a grid of `Card`s. |
| Status / Label | **Badge** | Use variants (`default`, `secondary`, `destructive`). |
| User Avatar | **Avatar** | Handles fallback initials automatically. |
| **Forms** | | |
| Text Input | **Input** | Standard text fields. |
| Large Text | **Textarea** | Multi-line input. |
| Pick One Option | **Select** | Native-like dropdown. |
| Pick Multiple | **Command** (Combobox) | Searchable multi-select. |
| Toggle On/Off | **Switch** | Better than a checkbox for "settings". |
| **Feedback** | | |
| Success/Error Msg | **Toast** (Sonner) | Non-blocking notifications. |
| Loading State | **Skeleton** | Placeholders while data fetches. |
| Progress | **Progress** | Percentage bars. |

By following these usage rules, AI agents will find it easier to navigate and modify the code. The consistency and transparency of having all UI code in-repo means agents can answer questions like “make the button green and add a spinner” by directly editing the Button component’s code, instead of guessing an API ￼ ￼. This leads to much higher success in automated UI implementations.

Collaboration and Scaling in a Multi-Agent Environment

Finally, to scale safely with multiple AI agents contributing to the code, enforce some collaboration conventions:
	•	Clear Task Boundaries: Assign each agent distinct components or sections to work on, based on the structure. For example, one agent can focus on building the StatsGrid component while another builds the page that uses it. The structured folder system (ui vs layout vs custom) helps here: agents can operate in parallel in different folders without merge conflicts.
	•	Consistent Coding Style (Prettier):
	    *   **Mandatory Config**: Ensure a `.prettierrc` exists with:
            ```json
            {
              "semi": true,
              "singleQuote": false,
              "tabWidth": 2,
              "trailingComma": "es5",
              "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
            }
            ```
        *   **Why?** This prevents agents from fighting over indentation or class sorting. The `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` is critical for keeping class names sorted and readable.
	•	Automated Checks: Integrate TypeScript type checking and run tests (if any) after agents make changes. The agents should be instructed to keep the build passing. Type errors or failing tests act as feedback for agents to correct mistakes, ensuring higher reliability.
	•	Documentation for Agents: Maintain this guide (and maybe additional README notes in the repo) up-to-date as the source of truth. If a new pattern or rule emerges (for instance, you add a new folder or a new design token), update the documentation. Agents can be directed to read these notes before coding, aligning their output with the established norms.

By investing in a well-structured project and clear guidelines, you create an environment where AI coding agents can successfully contribute to a Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui codebase. The components and layouts defined above act as reusable primitives that agents can assemble and modify confidently. The uniform Tailwind utility usage and owned component source code mean the AI doesn’t need to guess hidden library behaviors – everything is in the open, in TypeScript, in our project ￼ ￼. This significantly boosts the success rate of AI-driven implementation and minimizes human intervention for UI tasks.
